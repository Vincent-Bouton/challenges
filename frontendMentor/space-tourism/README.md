## My process

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TresJS](https://tres.js.org/)
- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)

### What I learned
I tried to push myself, and learn things that I never used before, like ThreeJS. I learned a lot about Astro :
- `viewTransition` is a great feature, that allows you to create a transition between pages, and it's very easy to use.
- `Data collection`, and how to use it in the components.
- `Astro Island`, and how to use it to create a website with multiple pages.

I ended up using TresJS to create the 3D models, and animations. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about it.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about ThreeJS, and how to create more complex 3D models, and animations.
Pushing myself to learn more in depth about Astro, this framework is amazing, and I want to use it more in the future.
